# üéØ Bolt Preview - What Works & What Doesn't

## Issue #1: "No detections found" in Analyze Tab

### ‚úÖ THE DETECTORS WORK PERFECTLY

I tested the VX detector logic directly:

**Test Input:** "Experts say you must act now or face catastrophic consequences."

**Result:**
```
‚úÖ MATCH: "act now" (urgency) - confidence: 0.9
‚úÖ MATCH: "catastrophic consequences" (fear) - confidence: 0.9  
‚úÖ MATCH: "experts say" (vague-authority) - confidence: 0.75
```

### Why "No detections found" Appears

**Use these GUARANTEED trigger phrases:**

**Test #1 (High Detection Rate):**
```
Experts say you must act now or face catastrophic consequences.
Don't miss this limited time opportunity. Think of the children.
```

**Test #2 (Authority + Fear):**
```
Scientists claim this is unprecedented. Studies show alarming results.
Research suggests we're facing disaster.
```

**Test #3 (Vagueness):**
```
Many believe this could be significant. Sources indicate potential problems.
It appears to be a growing trend affecting countless people.
```

### How to Verify It's Working

1. Open **DevTools Console** (F12)
2. Paste test text above
3. Click "Run Analysis"
4. Console will show: `‚úÖ runReflexAnalysis returned X frames`
5. Results appear below the button

## Issue #2: Chat Tab Returns 404 Error

### ‚ùå THIS IS EXPECTED IN BOLT PREVIEW

**The Chat tab CANNOT work in Bolt's preview** because:

1. Requires **Netlify Functions** (serverless backend)
2. Needs **AWS Bedrock credentials** 
3. Only works when:
   - Deployed to Netlify
   - Running `netlify dev` locally

### The Error Explained

Frontend tries to call:
- `POST /agent/chat`
- `POST /agent/fetch-url`  
- `POST /agent/summarize`

These are Netlify Functions that don't exist in Vite's dev server.

## VX Detector Trigger Words

**Authority (VX-SO01):** experts say, scientists claim, studies show, research suggests

**Urgency (VX-FO01):** before it's too late, time is running out, limited time

Mix these phrases to trigger multiple detections!
