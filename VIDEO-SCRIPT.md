# Truth Serum + Clarity Armor ‚Äî 3-Minute Demo Script

**Target Duration:** 3:00 minutes
**Platform:** YouTube (public, unlisted link for submission)
**Format:** Screen recording with voiceover

---

## [0:00-0:20] Opening & Hook (20 seconds)

**Visual:** Show homepage at clarityarmor.com with tagline

**Voiceover:**
> "What if AI could admit when it's unsure instead of confidently hallucinating? Truth Serum plus Clarity Armor is an AWS-powered autonomous agent that detects manipulation in text‚Äîand knows when to ask instead of bluff."

**On-screen text:**
- Truth Serum + Clarity Armor
- AWS AI Agent Competition 2025
- clarityarmor.com

**Action:** Quick scroll through homepage, hover over "Analyze" button

---

## [0:20-1:20] Demo 1: Real-Time Analysis (60 seconds)

**Visual:** Navigate to Analyze page

**Voiceover:**
> "Let me show you how it works. I'll paste a manipulative product claim: 'Studies show 87.3% of consumers prefer our brand over leading competitors.'"

**Action:**
1. Paste text into analysis box (3 sec)
2. Show handshake controls panel

**Voiceover:**
> "Before analyzing, I configure the handshake protocol‚Äîthis is what makes our agent different. I'm setting stakes to HIGH and confidence threshold to 70%. This means the agent must refuse or hedge if it's less than 70% confident."

**Action:**
3. Set `stakes = high`, `min_confidence = 0.70`, `cite_policy = force`
4. Click "Analyze" button

**Voiceover:**
> "Watch what happens. Two analysis paths run in parallel..."

**Visual:** Split screen showing:
- Left: Local VX reflexes firing (instant results appearing)
- Right: AWS agent processing indicator

**Action:**
5. Local VX results appear first (1-2 seconds)
6. Show 3 detected patterns highlighting:
   - **False Precision** (0.89) - "87.3%" without source
   - **Speculative Authority** (0.76) - "Studies" unnamed
   - **Vague Generalization** (0.68) - "leading competitors" undefined

**Voiceover:**
> "Local VX reflexes detected three manipulation patterns instantly. But now the AWS Bedrock agent enriches the analysis..."

**Action:**
7. Agent results appear (animated transition)
8. Expand first frame to show detailed rationale

**Visual:** Zoom into frame showing:
- Confidence score: 0.89
- Rationale: "Uses over-specific statistic (87.3%) without citing source or methodology"
- Suggestion: "Ask: Which studies? What was the sample size? Who funded the research?"

**Voiceover:**
> "The agent doesn't just say 'this is manipulation'‚Äîit explains WHY with confidence scores, rationale, and suggests what questions to ask next. That's explainable AI."

---

## [1:20-2:20] Demo 2: Session Memory (60 seconds)

**Visual:** Scroll to conversation interface at bottom of page

**Voiceover:**
> "Now here's what makes this a true autonomous agent‚Äîconversational memory with Supabase persistence."

**Action:**
1. Type in chat: "What patterns often appear together with false precision?"
2. Send message

**Visual:** Agent thinking indicator (AWS Bedrock logo pulsing)

**Action:**
3. Agent response appears:
> "False precision (VX-FP01) frequently co-fires with speculative authority (VX-AI01) and vague generalization (VX-VG01). When manipulators cite specific statistics like '87.3%', they often pair them with unnamed 'studies' or 'experts' to create an illusion of scientific rigor without providing verifiable sources..."

**Voiceover:**
> "The agent remembers our previous analysis and builds on it. But watch this..."

**Action:**
4. Show browser refresh (press F5, screen flickers)
5. Page reloads, conversation history STILL THERE

**Visual:** Session sidebar shows:
- Current session with message count
- Previous messages preserved

**Voiceover:**
> "Session persistence through Supabase means conversations survive page refreshes. This isn't just a chatbot‚Äîit's a production-ready agent with real memory."

**Action:**
6. Continue conversation: "Can you analyze this next statement for me?"
7. Paste new text: "A growing number of doctors recommend this supplement for daily wellness."

**Visual:** Agent processing, then returns VX frame

**Action:**
8. Show detection: **Vague Generalization** (0.81) - "growing number" and "doctors" both unspecified

**Voiceover:**
> "The agent maintains context from our entire conversation while analyzing new input. That's multi-turn reasoning powered by Amazon Bedrock Agents Runtime."

---

## [2:20-2:50] Architecture Deep Dive (30 seconds)

**Visual:** Switch to ARCHITECTURE-DIAGRAM.md (show Mermaid diagram)

**Voiceover:**
> "Here's how it works under the hood. Five AWS services working together..."

**Visual:** Highlight each service as mentioned:

**Voiceover:**
> "Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3.5 Sonnet for reasoning. Bedrock Agents Runtime for autonomous tool orchestration. AWS Lambda for serverless compute. API Gateway for REST endpoints. And CloudWatch for monitoring."

**Visual:** Animate data flow:
- User ‚Üí React Frontend ‚Üí Netlify Edge ‚Üí API Gateway ‚Üí Bedrock Agent ‚Üí Lambda Tools ‚Üí Supabase

**Voiceover:**
> "Local VX reflexes run client-side for instant feedback. AWS agent provides deep reasoning with autonomous tool calls. And Supabase PostgreSQL stores everything for session memory."

---

## [2:50-3:00] Closing & Call to Action (10 seconds)

**Visual:** Return to homepage with all features visible

**Voiceover:**
> "Truth Serum plus Clarity Armor: AI that knows when it doesn't know. Try it live at clarityarmor.com."
