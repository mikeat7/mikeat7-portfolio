# What We Updated During the AWS Competition Submission Period

## Project Status: Existing Platform Enhanced

**Truth Serum + Clarity Armor (TSCA)** was an existing project that we significantly enhanced during the AWS AI Agent Competition submission period. The platform previously had local VX pattern detection and basic AWS Bedrock integration, but lacked true agent capabilities and persistent memory.

---

## Major Enhancements During Submission Period

### 1. **Autonomous Agent Implementation with Bedrock Agents Runtime**

**Before:** Simple request-response LLM calls
**After:** Full autonomous agent with tool orchestration

- Integrated **Amazon Bedrock Agents Runtime** for autonomous decision-making
- Implemented **Lambda Action Groups** (fetch_url, analyze, chat handlers)
- Added tool schema definitions and autonomous tool invocation logic
- Agent now decides when to call tools based on analysis needs (e.g., fetches URLs when verification needed)

### 2. **Session Persistence & Conversational Memory (Supabase Integration)**

**Before:** Stateless interactions, no memory between requests
**After:** Full multi-turn conversational memory with database persistence

- Created **PostgreSQL schema** with two tables:
  - `conversation_sessions`: Session metadata with handshake configurations
  - `conversation_messages`: Full message history with VX frames and tool traces
- Implemented **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies for data protection
- Added **auto-incrementing message counters** via database triggers
- Built **session management utilities** (`sessionManager.ts`) with TypeScript
- Created **React hooks** (`useConversationSession`) for seamless frontend integration
- Conversations now persist across page refreshes and browser sessions
- Agent maintains context across multi-turn interactions

**Technical Achievement:** Messages include not just text, but also:
- VX detection frames (JSONB storage)
- Tool execution traces (fetch_url calls, etc.)
- Confidence scores for analysis quality tracking
- Extensible metadata for future enhancements

### 3. **Enhanced Backend Architecture**

**Before:** Single Lambda handler with basic routing
**After:** Modular, production-ready backend

- Restructured backend with **TypeScript** (`backend/src/`)
- Separated handlers: `chat.ts`, `analyze.ts`, `fetch_url.ts`
- Created **Bedrock SDK wrapper** (`lib/bedrock.ts`) with proper Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 API integration
- Implemented **HTML sanitization** for fetch_url tool (`lib/cleanHtml.ts`)
- Added proper **error handling** and **response transformation**
- Configured **Serverless Framework** for AWS deployment

### 4. **Netlify Edge Functions as Proxy Layer**

**Before:** Direct frontend-to-AWS calls (CORS issues, credential exposure risk)
**After:** Secure proxy layer with credential injection

- Created three Netlify Edge Functions:
  - `agent-chat.ts`: Proxies chat requests with handshake injection
  - `agent-analyze.ts`: Handles analysis requests with VX frame merging
  - `agent-fetch-url.ts`: Secure URL fetching with HTML cleaning
- Implemented **CORS handling** at edge layer
- Added **AWS credential injection** (no client-side secrets)
- Environment variable management via Netlify secrets

### 5. **Education Hub with AI-Powered Assessment**

**New Feature:** Advanced practice lessons with real-time AI evaluation

- Built **Epistemic Sandbox**: 5 interactive critical thinking exercises
- Built **Narrative Framing Analysis**: Master-level framing skills assessment
- Created **AdvancedAssessmentEngine** (`lib/assessment/`) with 8 weighted criteria:
  - Epistemic humility assessment (4 criteria: uncertainty acknowledgment, overconfidence avoidance, evidence-seeking, perspective-taking)
  - Narrative framing assessment (4 criteria: frame identification, emotional awareness, specificity, critical thinking depth)
- Integrated VX reflexes for manipulation pattern detection in student responses
- Real-time scoring with personalized feedback, strengths, improvements, and next steps
- Educational value: Teaches users to think like the agent

### 6. **Documentation & Testing Infrastructure**

**New during submission:**

- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Comprehensive 640-line technical documentation with Mermaid diagrams
- **ARCHITECTURE-DIAGRAM.md**: Simplified submission-friendly visual architecture
- **AWS-COMPETITION-SUMMARY.md**: Complete competition submission guide
- **SESSION-MEMORY-DEMO.md**: Session persistence demo script for video
- **INTEGRATION-EXAMPLE.md**: Code examples for session management
- **DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md**: Step-by-step deployment guide
- **test-agent-live.mjs**: Automated testing script for all endpoints

### 7. **Policy Governance & Codex v0.9 Handshake Protocol**

**Enhanced:** Full policy-driven agent behavior

- Codex handshake parameters now control agent behavior:
  - `mode` (--direct | --careful | --recap): Changes analysis style
  - `stakes` (low | medium | high): Adjusts confidence requirements
  - `min_confidence` (0-1): Threshold below which agent hedges or refuses
  - `cite_policy` (auto | force | off): Citation requirements
  - `omission_scan` (auto | boolean): Missing context detection
  - `reflex_profile` (default | strict | lenient): Sensitivity tuning

- Agent enforces policies autonomously:
  - Refuses to assert when confidence < threshold
  - Automatically calls fetch_url when verification needed
  - Surfaces omissions when stakes are high
  - Provides rationale for every decision

## Technical Metrics

**Lines of Code Added:** ~4,000+ lines (TypeScript, React, SQL)
**New Files Created:** 15+ files (handlers, utilities, hooks, components, docs)
**AWS Services Integrated:** 5 services (Bedrock, Bedrock Agents, Lambda, API Gateway, CloudWatch)
**Database Schema:** 2 tables, 16 columns, RLS policies, triggers, indexes
**Test Coverage:** Automated test script with 3 endpoint tests

## Why These Updates Matter for Competition Judging

### Demonstrates True Agent Capabilities
- **Autonomous tool use**: Agent decides when to fetch URLs, not hardcoded
- **Multi-turn reasoning**: Session memory enables complex, context-aware analysis
- **Policy governance**: Codex handshake shows advanced agent control

### Production-Ready Architecture
- **Session persistence**: Database-backed memory (not just in-memory)
- **Security**: RLS policies, cascading deletes, indexed queries
- **Scalability**: Serverless architecture, edge functions, database separation

### Educational Value
- **AI assessment system**: Shows we understand epistemic principles deeply
- **Transparent reasoning**: Every detection includes rationale, not black-box
- **User empowerment**: Teaches critical thinking skills, not just provides answers

### Technical Excellence
- **TypeScript throughout**: Type safety, no runtime surprises
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation, clear error messages
- **Documentation**: 6 comprehensive docs, architecture diagrams, test scripts

## Addressing Your Question: "Why Don't You Remember Yesterday?"

**Great question!** This highlights a fundamental limitation of current LLM systems:

**What We Added (Session Persistence):**
- ✅ **Application-level memory**: Your conversations with the TSCA agent persist in Supabase
- ✅ **Multi-turn context**: Agent remembers what you discussed in current session
- ✅ **Conversation history**: You can browse and resume past conversations
- ✅ **Database-backed**: Survives page refreshes, browser restarts, even device changes

**What We DON'T Have (True Long-Term Memory):**
- ❌ **AI personal memory**: The underlying LLM (Claude 3.5) doesn't remember individuals
- ❌ **Cross-session learning**: Agent doesn't learn from previous users' conversations
- ❌ **Persistent user profiles**: No "I remember you prefer X" capability

**Why This Limitation Exists:**
1. **Privacy & Security**: LLMs are intentionally stateless to protect user privacy
2. **Model Constraints**: Bedrock Claude doesn't have built-in persistent memory
3. **AWS Architecture**: Each Bedrock call is independent (no user-level memory)

**How We Work Around It:**
- Session ID passed with every request includes full conversation history
- Agent receives context from Supabase, not from model memory
- Effectively creates "memory illusion" through database retrieval

**Future Enhancement (Post-Competition):**
- User authentication + profile storage
- Preference learning (user-specific handshake defaults)
- Cross-conversation pattern recognition ("You've asked about omissions 3 times this week")

**Bottom Line:** Our session persistence gives the agent **working memory** (like RAM), but not **long-term memory** (like hard drive with personal history). That would require user accounts, authentication, and privacy controls—all future enhancements beyond the hackathon scope.

## Summary Paragraph for Submission Form

**Submission Update Summary:**

This platform existed before the competition as a local VX pattern detector with basic AWS Bedrock integration. During the submission period, we transformed it into a true autonomous AI agent by integrating **Amazon Bedrock Agents Runtime** for tool orchestration, implementing **Lambda Action Groups** with autonomous fetch_url capabilities, and adding **Supabase PostgreSQL session persistence** for conversational memory across page refreshes. We restructured the backend with modular TypeScript handlers, created a secure Netlify Edge proxy layer, built an AI-powered **Education Hub** with real-time epistemic humility assessment, and enhanced the **Codex v0.9 handshake protocol** for policy-governed agent behavior. The agent now autonomously decides when to call tools, maintains multi-turn context through database-backed sessions, and enforces epistemic principles (refusing to assert when confidence falls below thresholds). Technical additions include 4,000+ lines of TypeScript/React/SQL, comprehensive architecture documentation with Mermaid diagrams, automated testing scripts, and production-ready features like Row Level Security, indexed queries, and graceful error handling. Key innovation: dual analysis (local VX + cloud agent) with transparent reasoning—every detection includes confidence scores, rationale, and suggestions, avoiding black-box AI verdicts.
