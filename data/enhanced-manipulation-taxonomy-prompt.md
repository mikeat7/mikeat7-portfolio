# TRUTH SERUM + CLARITY ARMOR: ADVANCED MANIPULATION TAXONOMY PROJECT v2.0

## ðŸŽ¯ **MISSION: NEXT-GENERATION SEMANTIC BULLSHIT DETECTION**

Building on our successful 50-pattern foundation, we need **advanced manipulation techniques** that current systems miss. Focus on **sophisticated, subtle, and domain-specific** patterns used by expert propagandists.

## ðŸ“‹ **ADVANCED PATTERN REQUEST**

**You are a forensic linguistics expert specializing in advanced propaganda analysis. Identify manipulation techniques that require deep semantic understanding.**

### **CURRENT GAPS TO ADDRESS:**

Our system successfully detects basic patterns but **MISSES** these sophisticated techniques:

1. **"This breakthrough study changes everything we thought we knew"**
   - Temporal absolutism + authority transfer + manufactured significance
   - Creates false paradigm shift impression

2. **"While correlation doesn't prove causation, the pattern is undeniable"**
   - Statistical hedge + certainty assertion
   - Appears scientific while making unscientific claims

3. **"Even skeptics are starting to admit the evidence is overwhelming"**
   - Manufactured consensus + authority conversion
   - Implies resistance is crumbling without evidence

### **ADVANCED CATEGORIES TO ANALYZE:**

#### **1. NESTED MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES**
- Multiple patterns layered in single statements
- Contradictory signals that confuse analysis
- Semantic camouflage (manipulation disguised as objectivity)

#### **2. DOMAIN-SPECIFIC EXPERTISE MANIPULATION**
- **Medical**: "Doctors hate this one trick"
- **Financial**: "Market insiders don't want you to know"
- **Technology**: "This will disrupt everything"
- **Academic**: "Peer review suppresses this research"

#### **3. TEMPORAL AND CAUSAL MANIPULATION**
- False historical parallels
- Manufactured urgency through fake deadlines
- Causal chain manipulation
- "Slippery slope" variants

#### **4. STATISTICAL AND NUMERICAL DECEPTION**
- Correlation presented as causation
- Sample size manipulation
- Baseline shifting
- Percentage vs. absolute number confusion

#### **5. META-MANIPULATION TECHNIQUES**
- Preemptive credibility attacks ("They'll call this conspiracy")
- False balance ("Both sides have valid points")
- Manufactured complexity ("It's more nuanced than that")
- Epistemic humility weaponization ("We can't know for sure, but...")

### **ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK v2.0:**

For each advanced technique, provide:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "name": "Human-readable name",
  "category": "nested|domain-specific|temporal|statistical|meta",
  "sophistication_level": "basic|intermediate|advanced|expert",
  "description": "What this technique does psychologically",
  "semantic_indicators": [
    "complex linguistic patterns that signal this technique"
  ],
  "context_dependencies": [
    "situational factors that activate this pattern"
  ],
  "nested_techniques": [
    "other manipulation patterns this combines with"
  ],
  "domain_specificity": "general|medical|financial|political|academic|technology",
  "examples": [
    "real-world examples showing sophisticated usage"
  ],
  "psychological_mechanism": "Advanced cognitive bias exploitation",
  "counter_detection": "How this technique evades simple keyword detection",
  "detection_confidence": 0.85,
  "false_positive_risk": "low|medium|high",
  "severity": "low|medium|high|critical"
}
```

### **SPECIFIC ADVANCED REQUESTS:**

#### **A. EXPERT-LEVEL PROPAGANDA TECHNIQUES**
- Techniques used by state actors and sophisticated influence operations
- Multi-layered semantic manipulation
- Cultural and psychological targeting
- Long-term narrative construction

#### **B. ACADEMIC AND SCIENTIFIC MANIPULATION**
- Peer review gaming
- Citation manipulation
- Methodology obfuscation
- False expertise claims

#### **C. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC MANIPULATION**
- Market psychology exploitation
- Risk/reward framing manipulation
- Scarcity and abundance illusions
- Authority transfer in financial advice

#### **D. MEDICAL AND HEALTH MANIPULATION**
- Treatment efficacy exaggeration
- Risk amplification/minimization
- Authority figure exploitation
- Anecdotal evidence weaponization

### **DETECTION SOPHISTICATION REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **Semantic Context Awareness**: Same words mean different things in different contexts
2. **Multi-Pattern Recognition**: Detecting technique combinations
3. **Domain Expertise Integration**: Understanding field-specific manipulation
4. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Recognizing regional/cultural manipulation variants
5. **Temporal Pattern Recognition**: Detecting manipulation campaigns over time

### **OUTPUT FORMAT:**

Provide a comprehensive JSON taxonomy with **at least 25 advanced manipulation patterns**, focusing on:

- **Expert-level techniques** that require sophisticated detection
- **Domain-specific patterns** for major influence sectors
- **Nested combinations** of multiple basic techniques
- **Meta-manipulation** that targets the detection process itself

### **QUALITY CRITERIA v2.0:**

1. **Sophistication**: Must require advanced semantic analysis to detect
2. **Real-world Impact**: Must catch actual advanced propaganda in the wild
3. **Low False Positives**: Must distinguish manipulation from legitimate expertise
4. **Scalable Detection**: Must work across different topics within domains
5. **Counter-Evasion**: Must be robust against attempts to game the system

---

**This advanced taxonomy will power the next evolution of automated manipulation detection, capable of catching expert-level propaganda that currently evades all existing systems.**
