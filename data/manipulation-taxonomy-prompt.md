# TRUTH SERUM + CLARITY ARMOR: MANIPULATION PATTERN TAXONOMY PROJECT

## ðŸŽ¯ **MISSION: COMPREHENSIVE BULLSHIT DETECTION**

We are building the world's most comprehensive database of **semantic manipulation patterns** for automated detection. We need language experts (humans and LLMs) to identify every known technique used to bypass critical thinking.

## ðŸ“‹ **EXPERT ANALYSIS REQUEST**

**You are a linguistic manipulation expert. Your task is to identify and categorize sophisticated propaganda techniques that current keyword-based systems miss.**

### **CURRENT DETECTION GAPS:**

Our system **FAILED** to detect these sophisticated manipulations:

1. **"As much as we want to put it behind us, COVID-19 isn't going away"**
   - Creates false consensus ("we want")
   - Emotional framing (resignation)
   - Inevitability framing ("isn't going away")

2. **"Ivermectin is only good for horses"**
   - False limitation ("only good for")
   - Dismissive medical framing
   - Implicit authority (unstated medical consensus)

3. **"Cases are currently rising across the country in a summer surge"**
   - Vague quantification ("rising")
   - Crisis amplification ("surge")
   - Geographic generalization ("across the country")

### **ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:**

For each manipulation technique, provide:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-identifier",
  "name": "Human-readable name",
  "category": "emotional|logical|authority|consensus|framing|distraction",
  "description": "What this technique does psychologically",
  "semantic_indicators": [
    "linguistic patterns that signal this technique"
  ],
  "context_clues": [
    "surrounding words that increase confidence"
  ],
  "examples": [
    "real-world examples of this technique"
  ],
  "psychological_mechanism": "How this bypasses critical thinking",
  "detection_confidence": 0.85,
  "severity": "low|medium|high|critical"
}
```

### **CATEGORIES TO ANALYZE:**

#### **1. EMOTIONAL MANIPULATION**
- Fear amplification
- Guilt induction
- False urgency
- Emotional consensus manufacturing
- Victimization framing

#### **2. LOGICAL FALLACIES**
- False dichotomies
- Strawman arguments
- Ad hominem attacks
- Slippery slope
- Appeal to consequences

#### **3. AUTHORITY MANIPULATION**
- Vague expert appeals
- Institutional name-dropping
- False scientific consensus
- Credential inflation
- Authority transfer

#### **4. CONSENSUS MANUFACTURING**
- Bandwagon effects
- False popularity
- Implied agreement
- Social proof fabrication
- Majority assumption

#### **5. FRAMING TECHNIQUES**
- Problem-reaction-solution
- False limitation
- Dismissive categorization
- Context stripping
- Narrative oversimplification

#### **6. DISTRACTION TACTICS**
- Red herrings
- Topic shifting
- Emotional flooding
- Information overload
- Complexity inflation

### **SPECIFIC ANALYSIS REQUESTS:**

#### **A. NEWS MEDIA MANIPULATION**
Analyze common techniques in:
- Headlines that create emotional responses
- Buried disclaimers and data limitations
- Statistical manipulation
- Source attribution games
- Crisis language amplification

#### **B. POLITICAL RHETORIC**
Identify patterns in:
- Campaign messaging
- Policy justification
- Opposition framing
- Consensus manufacturing
- Fear-based motivation

#### **C. COMMERCIAL PERSUASION**
Detect techniques in:
- Marketing copy
- Product positioning
- Scarcity creation
- Authority borrowing
- Social proof manufacturing

#### **D. SOCIAL MEDIA MANIPULATION**
Recognize patterns in:
- Viral content design
- Engagement manipulation
- Echo chamber reinforcement
- Outrage amplification
- Tribal signaling

### **OUTPUT FORMAT:**

Please provide a comprehensive JSON taxonomy with **at least 50 distinct manipulation patterns**, organized by category, with semantic detection rules for each.

### **QUALITY CRITERIA:**

1. **Semantic Precision**: Patterns must be detectable through linguistic analysis
2. **Psychological Accuracy**: Must reflect actual cognitive biases and manipulation techniques
3. **Real-world Applicability**: Must catch actual propaganda, not just theoretical examples
4. **Scalable Detection**: Must work across different topics and contexts
5. **Confidence Calibration**: Detection confidence must correlate with actual manipulation likelihood

### **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:**

- **Catch sophisticated propaganda** that sounds reasonable on surface
- **Minimize false positives** on legitimate discourse
- **Scale across domains** (medical, political, commercial, social)
- **Detect layered techniques** where multiple patterns combine
- **Identify context-dependent manipulation** where same words mean different things

**This taxonomy will power the next generation of automated bullshit detection. Your expertise is crucial for protecting democratic discourse and critical thinking.**
