            severity: "high",
            rationale: "Uses meaningless corporate jargon to obscure simple concepts",
            explanation: "This phrase combines two business buzzwords that sound sophisticated but convey little actual meaning. 'Leverage synergies' typically means 'use combined resources' but the jargon makes simple concepts sound more complex and authoritative than they are."

            severity: "medium",
            rationale: "Transforms simple actions into complex-sounding processes",
            explanation: "This term takes the simple concept of 'implement' or 'put into practice' and makes it sound more technical and important. It's often used to make routine activities appear more strategic or sophisticated."

            phrase: "scalable solutions",
            type: "tech-buzzwords",
            severity: "medium",
            rationale: "Uses technical jargon to make vague promises sound concrete",
            explanation: "While 'scalable' has specific technical meaning, it's often used as a buzzword to make any proposal sound more impressive and future-ready, even when scalability isn't relevant or the 'solution' isn't clearly defined."

            type: "transformation-jargon",
            severity: "high",
            rationale: "Overuses academic terminology to inflate importance of changes",
            explanation: "This phrase, borrowed from scientific philosophy, is often misused to make any change sound revolutionary and fundamental, even when describing minor adjustments or normal business evolution."
