            severity: "high",
            rationale: "Presents speculation as probable fact without supporting evidence",
            explanation: "The phrase 'likely growing' suggests probability without providing the statistical basis for that assessment. This creates false confidence in uncertain projections."

            type: "speculation",
            severity: "medium",
            rationale: "Uses speculative language without providing evidence or clear attribution",
            explanation: "The word 'may' introduces uncertainty while presenting information as potentially factual. This hedging language can mask the lack of concrete evidence or create false impressions of possibility without proper justification."

            phrase: "possibly",
            type: "speculation",
            severity: "high",
            rationale: "Presents speculation as potential fact without supporting evidence",
            explanation: "The term 'possibly' suggests likelihood without providing any basis for that assessment. This creates an illusion of informed speculation while actually offering no substantive information."

            type: "double-speculation",
            severity: "high",
            rationale: "Double speculative language compounds uncertainty while masking lack of evidence",
            explanation: "Combining 'could' and 'potentially' creates layered speculation that sounds more authoritative than it is. This pattern often disguises complete uncertainty as measured possibility."

            type: "speculation",
