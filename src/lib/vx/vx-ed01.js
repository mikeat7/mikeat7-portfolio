            type: "moral-framing",
            severity: "high",
            rationale: "Uses fairness appeal to justify potentially biased actions",
            explanation: "This phrase invokes moral authority ('fairness') to bypass logical scrutiny. It assumes universal agreement on what constitutes 'fair' while potentially advancing a particular agenda under the guise of moral righteousness."

            phrase: "for the greater good",
            type: "utilitarian-manipulation",
            severity: "high",
            rationale: "Utilitarian framing used to justify ethical compromises",
            explanation: "This classic utilitarian phrase is often used to rationalize harmful actions by appealing to collective benefit. It can mask individual rights violations or ethical shortcuts by claiming broader positive outcomes."

            severity: "high",
            rationale: "Explicitly acknowledges harm while attempting to justify it",
            explanation: "This phrase admits wrongdoing while trying to make it acceptable through necessity claims. It's a form of ethical drift that normalizes harmful behavior by framing it as unavoidable."

            phrase: "you owe it to",
            type: "obligation-manipulation",
            severity: "medium",
            rationale: "Creates artificial moral obligations to influence behavior",
            explanation: "This phrase manufactures debt or duty where none may exist, using guilt and social pressure to compel action rather than relying on genuine persuasion or evidence."
