      phrase: "crisis", 
      type: "urgency-escalation", 
      severity: "high",
      rationale: "Uses crisis language to manufacture urgency and bypass deliberation",
      explanation: "The word 'crisis' immediately elevates emotional stakes and suggests immediate action is required. This can be used to short-circuit normal decision-making processes by creating artificial time pressure and emotional intensity."
    },
    { 
      phrase: "unacceptable", 
      type: "moral-escalation", 
      severity: "high",
      rationale: "Declares situations intolerable to shut down discussion",
      explanation: "This term presents a subjective judgment as objective fact, implying that no reasonable person could disagree. It escalates emotional tone while potentially closing off legitimate debate or alternative perspectives."
    },
    { 
      phrase: "we must fight", 
      type: "combat-framing", 
      severity: "high",
      rationale: "Uses warfare metaphors to escalate conflict and polarize positions",
      explanation: "Military language transforms disagreements into battles, making compromise seem like surrender and opponents into enemies. This framing escalates emotional intensity and can justify increasingly extreme responses."
    },
    { 
      phrase: "catastrophe", 
      type: "disaster-framing", 
      severity: "high",
      rationale: "Employs catastrophic language to amplify fear and urgency",
      explanation: "This term maximizes emotional impact by suggesting total disaster. It can be used to justify extreme measures or create panic that overwhelms rational assessment of actual risks and appropriate responses."
